# xv6 Enhanced OS

My implementation and experiments with the xv6 operating system as part of my OS course. xv6 is a simple Unix-like teaching operating system developed by MIT. This project includes various system calls, process management, and memory handling features, along with custom scheduling algorithms.

- Operating Systems Course - Spring 2023

## Key Features
- Implementation of core OS concepts such as scheduling, system calls, and file system management.
- Custom scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Round Robin.
- Modifications and extensions to the original xv6 OS for learning purposes.
